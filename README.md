# Custom Toggle Buttons

A custom ToggleButtons implementation that allows more flexibility than Flutter's inbuilt ToggleButtons.

## Features
- Horizontal and Vertical Alignment support
- Elevation support
- More customization for each state (selected, disabled, unselected
- Similar look and feel as Flutter Material CustomButtons

## Getting started

Add this dependency to your package's pubspec.yaml file:
```
dependencies:
  ...
  customtogglebuttons: ^0.0.5
```
and install it by running the following in your command line:
```
flutter pub get
```

Now you can use this in your source file by adding the following import:

```dart
import 'package:customtogglebuttons/customtogglebuttons.dart';
```

## Usage

The simplest example is below, it creates a 2 icon set of toggle buttons that can be selected or unselected on each click.

Create a list of boolean values to store selected/unselected state:
```dart
List<bool> _isSelected = [false, false];
```

In your build method:

```dart
CustomToggleButtons(
	isSelected: _isSelected,
	children: <Widget>[
		Icon(Icons.add),
		Icon(Icons.remove),
	],
	onPressed: (index) {
		setState(() {
			_isSelected[index] = !_isSelected[index];
		});
	},
),
```

**NOTE:** The length of the bool List you pass in `isSelected` has to be the same as the length of the `children` list.


## Examples

The source code for all examples is available in the [example/lib/main.dart](https://github.com/jitinder/customtogglebuttons/blob/master/example/lib/main.dart "example/lib/main.dart") file.

You can run the [example](https://github.com/jitinder/customtogglebuttons/tree/master/example "example") app on your mobile device and have a look at each of the samples in action.

##### Default

Shows the default behaviour without any additional styling properties. When the width of the buttons is longer than the available width, the next buttons automatically wrap to the next line.
